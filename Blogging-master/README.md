# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Description

Our Blog Application is a robust, user-friendly platform for creating, managing, and viewing blog posts. Built with modern technologies like React.js, Material-UI (MUI) for styling, Redux for state management, this application offers an intuitive and engaging user experience. Additionally, it includes a theme switcher to toggle between light and dark modes, enhancing accessibility and user preference customization.

## Features

####  Post Management

Create Post: Users can create new blog posts using a rich text editor. The editor supports various text formatting options, making it easy to create visually appealing content.
Edit Post: Users can edit their existing posts, allowing them to update and improve content over time.
Delete Post: Users can delete their posts if they no longer wish to display them.
View Posts: All users can view a list of posts and read individual posts. The list view provides a quick overview, while the detailed view offers a full reading experience.

####  Theme Switching

Light and Dark Modes: Users can toggle between light and dark modes using a theme switcher. This feature enhances accessibility and user comfort, especially in different lighting conditions.

#### Technical Stack

Frontend
React.js: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, providing a component-based architecture and efficient rendering.
Material-UI (MUI): A popular React UI framework that offers a comprehensive set of customizable components and styles, ensuring a modern and responsive design.
State Management
Redux: A predictable state container for JavaScript apps, allowing for centralized state management and easy debugging.


## Deployment URL
This is project url
https://github.com/Omgawade46/Blog_App/tree/main/Blogging-master/src

## Ready to setup

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
